Copy and paste in link at the top, for example this (real video link):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmxDZSokzE&t=3965s

#3
Scroll Down Find "Audio Only", hit Control + F on PC or Command + F on Mac and search "Audio Only".
Go for the ones that have "webm"
Higher kbps is better quality, recommend lowest, since uses less space and produces similar quality to real video.

Right click on "Download"
Click "Save Link As..."
Save as "All Files" change it to All Files

Rename to any file name .mp3
For example: chillmusic_1.mp3

Then hit save
